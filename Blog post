Dear all,

The program I wrote used K-Mean clustering method to cluster neighborhoods in any city in Alabama based on the similarity of the
most popular venue categories in the neighborhoods. Users can define the target cities by changing the name and the zip codes in
the main program. The program will output the map of each target city and display the clusters on the map with different colors.

The program pulls zip codes in Alabama from a website called "Zip codes to go". The geographical data of each zip code is gathered 
by using the Geocoder lib.

You are welcomed to download the code. If you have any question, please feel free to leave a message to me. Thank you very much!
