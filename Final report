Introduction:
In this project, the task is finding what are the top 10 most popular venue categories in the two major cities, 
Birmingham and Huntsville, in the state of Alabama, USA, by leveraging the venue data in Foursquare. Then, we will 
use the data to determine where would be the best place to open a coffee shop in the two cities. Small business 
is very popular in Alabama. However, it is difficult to find out what is the most popular business category in each city. 
With the help of data science, it would be possible to classify the most popular venues in each neighborhood. 

Here, I would like to use my data science knowledge to find out what are the most popular venue categories in Birmingham, AL.
Then I will find the most popular venues in Huntsville, AL, and compare them to the results that I found in Birmingham area.

First, the geological information of Birmingham and Huntsville will be found by using Geocoder library. 
Then, the number of venues of each category in both cities will be counted, and the foot trend of each category will be 
found from the database of Foursquare.

Data used in the research:
Here is the list that shows all the data used in the project.
1. Names of the cities
2. Zip code of each neighborhood in the cities
3. Latitude and Longitude of each neighborhood
4. Top 10 most popular venue categories in each neighborhood in the cities
5. 

In order to collect the venue data of Birmingham metropolitan area, the zip code for each neighborhood need to be known. 
In this project, the zip codes of the neighborhoods in Brimingham area are gathered from a website named "Zip codes to go".
The URL of the website is: https://www.zipcodestogo.com/Alabama/. Then, the latitude and the longitude of each neighborhood can
be determined by using the Geocoder library.
