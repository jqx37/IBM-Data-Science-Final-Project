Introduction:
In this project, the task is finding what are the top 10 most popular venue categories in the two major cities, Birmingham and Huntsville, in the state of Alabama, USA, by leveraging the venue data in Foursquare. Small business is very popular in Alabama. However, it is difficult to find out what is the most popular business category in each city. With the help of data science, it would be possible to classify the most popular venues in each neighborhood. Based on our living experience, restaurants and fitness centers are very popular around Birmingham area. In this project, I would like to use my data science knowledge to proof that the most popular venue categories in Birmingham, AL include fitness centers and restaurants. Then I will find the most popular venues in Huntsville, AL, and compare them to the results that I found in Birmingham area.
First, the geological information of Birmingham and Huntsville will be found by using Geocoder library. Then, the number of venues of each category in both cities will be counted, and the foot trend of each category will be found from the database of Foursquare.
